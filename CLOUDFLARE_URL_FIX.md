# Troubleshooting: 404 Not Found

You are seeing a "Page Not Found" error because of a small typo in the web address.

**Your Project Name:** `booknest`
**The URL you visited:** `booksnest-e2j.pages.dev` (Notice the extra 's' in "books")

## How to Fix It

1. Go back to the **Cloudflare Dashboard**.
2. Click on **Workers & Pages** in the left sidebar.
3. Click on your project **booknest**.
4. On the right side, you will see a button or link that says **Visit site**. Click that button.

It should take you to a URL that looks like `https://booknest.pages.dev` (or similar, without the extra 's').
